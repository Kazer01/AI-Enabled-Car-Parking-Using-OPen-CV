<h1>AI-Enabled-Car-Parking-Using-Open-CV</h1>
AI-enabled car parking using OpenCV involves using computer vision techniques to detect and navigate a car to park it automatically in a parking space. Here's a brief overview of the process:

Image Acquisition: The car's camera captures live video frames of the surrounding environment while looking for an available parking space.

Object Detection: OpenCV's pre-trained object detection models (such as YOLO or SSD) are utilized to detect cars and other obstacles in the video frames.

Lane Detection: OpenCV algorithms are employed to identify lane markings and guide the car within the lanes.

Parking Space Detection: By analyzing the detected objects and lane positions, the system identifies available parking spaces and calculates the best-suited spot for parking.

Path Planning: Based on the location of the parking space and the current position of the car, a path planning algorithm determines the optimal trajectory to reach the parking spot.

Control System: The car's control system, integrated with OpenCV, guides the vehicle to follow the planned path and adjust its speed and steering angle accordingly.

Parking Execution: The car autonomously maneuvers into the parking space, ensuring safety and avoiding collisions with other objects.

Feedback and Monitoring: Throughout the parking process, the system continuously monitors the surroundings and adjusts the car's movements if necessary.

It's important to note that this is a high-level overview, and implementing a fully functional AI-enabled car parking system involves more detailed steps and considerations, such as fine-tuning the object detection models, handling different parking scenarios, and ensuring robustness and safety in real-world conditions.
